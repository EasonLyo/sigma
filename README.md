# SIGMA

ðŸ‘†[ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£](./README_zh.md)

A high performances API gateway based on Vertx(Netty), can execute on native image.

# Feature List

1. **Route**
2. **Upstream**
3. **reverse-proxy**
4. **Load balance**

5. **plugin**

# Roadmap

![ROADMAP](./image/SIGMA-ROADMAP.png)

# Milestone

- 2024-10-08 the version 0.1.0-alpha is done.

# Benchmark

## Benchmark Environments

Apple M1 Pro(10 vCPUs, 16 GB memory)

## Benchmark Test for reverse proxy

Only use sigma as the reverse proxy server,include path rewrite plugin,with no logging,or other plugins enabled.

## QPS

Because of M1 Pro CPU arch , it dont have Hyper-Threading tech, so, The test use 4 core for wrk, 4 core for nginx or sigma reverse proxy, and 2 core for upstream, upstream is only return a simple json response:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "msg": "success",
  "data": null
}
```
### Upstream(on port 8888 and 8889)

### Sigma(on port 80, path rewrite /test/* to /):

Running 1m test @ http://localhost/test/benchmark

> Sigma is just a little bit faster than Nginx in some situation, but it's still very fast and we have a lot of room to improve.
